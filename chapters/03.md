## Working Haskell Types

```haskell
p :: Float
p = 3.14

p = 3.14 :: Float

λ :type x

addOne :: Int -> Int
addOne = (+ 1)
```

What about functions that take multiple arguments? Let’s take a look at an example first, and then pick apart why it works:

```haskell
addThreeNumbers :: Int -> (Int -> (Int -> Int))
addThreeNumbers a b c = a + b + c
```

This is because:

```haskell
addThreeNumbers = \a -> \b -> \c -> a + b + c
addThreeNumbers x y z =
  let
    f :: Int -> (Int -> (Int -> Int))
    f a =
      let
        g :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
        g b =
          let
            h :: Int -> Int
            h c = a + b + c
           in
            h
       in
        g
   in
    f x y z
-- in ((f x) y) z
```

Just like function application at the value level, we can usually drop the extra parentheses when we’re writing types for Haskell functions. Unlike function application, function types are right associative, so instead of Int -> (Int -> Int) we can write Int -> Int -> Int. In the case of addThreeNumbers, we can drop all of our parentheses and simply write:

```haskell
addThreeNumbers :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
```

## Reading Type Errors

```haskell
λ "one" :: Int
<interactive>:1:1: error:
    • No instance for (Data.String.IsString Int)
        arising from the literal ‘"one "’
    • In the expression: "one " :: Int
    In an equation for ‘it’: it = "one " :: Int
```

The very first part of our error message is telling us what happened (an error), and where. The <interactive> marker is telling us that this error ocurred in an interactive session through ghci. If your error message was in a file, then it would have the full path to the file containing the error. The next two numbers are the line number of the error and the column of text where the expression containing the error started. In this case, the error occurred starting with the first character, on the first line of our ghci session. If you ran this command in an existing ghci session, or typed the example into a file instead of the REPL, then you might have had a different location in your error message.
`• Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘[Char]’`
The next line of the error message tells exactly what went wrong. The compiler expected an Int, because we told it that’s what it should expect with our type annotation, but the actual value of the expression was [Char]. The way the compiler phrases this error message gives you a hint into how it detects errors. A lot of error messages that the compiler will find for you happen because you have a value that the compiler has inferred a type for, and you’re trying to use it in an expression that has some other type, and the compiler can’t figure out how the two types can match up.
`• In the expression: "one" :: Int`
The next line of the error message tells you what expression contained the error. In this case, the entire line only contained a single expression. When you have errors in longer programs, this section of the error message can become quite long, and it can take some practice to get a better understanding of how to read it effectively.
`In an equation for ‘it’: it = "one" :: Int`
The final line of the error message is providing some additional context to the error. In this case, it’s telling you that the expression was being assigned to a variable called it. The it variable is how ghci refers to your current statement in the REPL, so you won’t see it in errors you are building from a source file.

```haskell
λ (True, False) :: (Bool, Int)
<interactive>:2:8: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Bool’
    • In the expression: False
      In the expression: (True, False) :: (Bool, Int)
      In an equation for ‘it’: it = (True, False3) :: (Bool, Int)
```

## Working with Polymorphic Functions
1. Parameter monomorphism `Int -> Int`
2. Parameter polymorphism `a -> b` 
3. ad hoc polymorphism `not yet`

Example of **type variable**:
```haskell
identity :: a -> a
identity val = val

identity2 :: Abc -> Abc
identity2 val = val
```
Just like a regular variable in Haskell can represent any value of the appropriate type, a type variable in Haskell can represent any type of the appropriate _kind_.

## Exploring the Type Space of an Application with Undefined
Example of a program that will take a list of lists of numbers, return a string with a comma-separated list of numbers, where each number is the sum of all occurrences of the biggest number in sub-array, minus the sum of all occurrences of the smallest number in sub-array.

```haskell
sumBiggest :: [[Int]] -> String
sumBiggest allNums =
  let
    getBiggests :: [Int] -> [Int]
    getBiggests nums = undefined
    getSmallests :: [Int] -> [Int]
    getSmallests nums = undefined
    differences :: ([Int], [Int]) -> Int
    differences pairs = undefined
    allBiggests :: [[Int]]
    allBiggests = map getBiggests allNums
    allSmallests :: [[Int]]
    allSmallests = map getSmallests allNums
    sizePairs :: [([Int], [Int])]
    sizePairs = zip allBiggests allSmallests
    differences' :: [String]
    differences' = map (show . differences) sizePairs
   in
    Data.List.intercalate "," differences'

sumBiggest :: [[Int]] -> String
sumBiggest allNums =
  let
    getBiggests :: [Int] -> [Int]
    getBiggests nums =
      let
        biggestNumber = foldr max (head nums) (tail nums)
       in
        filter (== biggestNumber) nums
    getSmallests :: [Int] -> [Int]
    getSmallests nums =
      let
        smallestNumber = foldr min (head nums) (tail nums)
       in
        filter (== smallestNumber) nums
    differences :: ([Int], [Int]) -> Int
    differences (x, y) = sum x - sum y
    allBiggests :: [[Int]]
    allBiggests = map getBiggests allNums
    allSmallests :: [[Int]]
    allSmallests = map getSmallests allNums
    sizePairs :: [([Int], [Int])]
    sizePairs = zip allBiggests allSmallests
    differences' :: [String]
    differences' = map (show . differences) sizePairs
   in
    Data.List.intercalate "," differences'
```
