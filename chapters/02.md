# Chapter 2
## Writing Code Using Lists
### Operators:
1. `<>` ex. `[1, 2] <> [3, 4] == [1, 2, 3, 4]` join lists (as well as strings as they are lists of chars)
2. `!!` ex. `[1, 2] !! 0 == 1` get element at index
3. `:` (cons or construct) ex. `1 : [2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]` creates new list and adds element to the beginning
### Functions
1. `head` ex. `head [1, 2, 3] == 1` returns the first element of a list
2. `tail` ex. `tail [1, 2, 3] == [2, 3]` returns all elements starting with index 1 or without head
`head : tail = head : (head : (head : ... : []))`

## Creating Lists Recursively
Example of creating a list [n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1]:
```haskell
countdown n =
  if n <= 0
    then []
    else n : countdown (n - 1)
```

Example of a function that creates a list of prime factors of a number (prime factor is a zero-remainder prime denominator, ex. number = 8, prime factors 2, 2, 2 or number = 33, prime factors 3, 11):
```haskell
factors num =
  factors' num 2
 where
  factors' num fact
    | num == 1 = []
    | (num `rem` fact) == 0 = fact : factors' (num `div` fact) fact
    | otherwise = factors' num (fact + 1)
```
