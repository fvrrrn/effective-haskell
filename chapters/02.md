# Chapter 2
## Writing Code Using Lists
### Operators:
1. `<>` ex. `[1, 2] <> [3, 4] == [1, 2, 3, 4]` join lists (as well as strings as they are lists of chars)
2. `!!` ex. `[1, 2] !! 0 == 1` get element at index
3. `:` (cons or construct) ex. `1 : [2, 3` creates new list and adds element to the beginning
### Functions
1. `head` ex. `head [1, 2, 3] == 1` returns the first element of a list
2. `tail` ex. `tail [1, 2, 3] == [2, 3]` returns all elements starting with index 1 or without head
`head : tail = head : (head : (head : ... : []))`
