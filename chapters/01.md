# Chapter 1
## Working with lists
If no step is present then 1 takes precedence:
```haskell
λ [1..5]
[1,2,3,4,5]
```
If starting at the same value then list with this value:
```haskell
λ [10..10]
[10]
```
If starting with a value that is larger than ending then:
```haskell
λ [10..1]
[]
```
But if step is specified:
```haskell
λ [10,9..0]
[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]
```

If step is specified then continue on with it:
```haskell
λ [2,4..10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
```
If step is specified but last value is not included:
```haskell
λ [0,23..100]
[0,23,46,69,92]
```
## Creating Lists with More Than One Type
In Haskell, a list can only contain one type of value at a time:
```haskell
λ [1, "two"]
<interactive>:6:1: error:
• Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘print’
prevents the constraint ‘(Show a0)’ from being solved.
Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
These potential instances exist:
instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
instance Show Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
instance Show a => Show (Maybe a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
...plus 22 others
...plus 15 instances involving out-of-scope types
(use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
• In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it
```
