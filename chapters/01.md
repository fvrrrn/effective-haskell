# Chapter 1
## Working with lists
If no step is present then 1 takes precedence:
```haskell
λ [1..5]
[1,2,3,4,5]
```
If starting at the same value then list with this value:
```haskell
λ [10..10]
[10]
```
If starting with a value that is larger than ending then:
```haskell
λ [10..1]
[]
```
But if step is specified:
```haskell
λ [10,9..0]
[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]
```

If step is specified then continue on with it:
```haskell
λ [2,4..10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
```
If step is specified but last value is not included:
```haskell
λ [0,23..100]
[0,23,46,69,92]
```
