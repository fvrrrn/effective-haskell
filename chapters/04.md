## Creating Data Types and Records

Example of creating a type:

```haskell
data CustomerInfo
```

Example of creating a type's constructor:

```haskell
data CustomerInfo = CustomerInfo
data CustomerInfo = CustomerInfo123
data CustomerInfo = abc123

solidCustomerInfo = abc123
-- :t solidCustomerInfo -> CustomerInfo
```

Having the same exact word define two things called `punning` in Haskell because:

> A joke-pun uses the fact that the same word has multiple meanings¹. with records, the "word" is the record field, whose name usually refers to the accessor function, but with NamedFieldPuns it gains a second meaning – the value of the field. or something like that

Unfortunately, right now our CustomerInfo type only has a single inhabitant, which is the value we create when we call CustomerInfo. Values with a single inhabitant can also be quite useful in practice. The type with a single inhabitant in Haskell is often called Unit, or (). Although we can’t actually define () ourselves since it’s special syntax that’s built into the language, you can think of it as being defined like this: `data () = ()`

```haskell
data CustomerInfo = CustomerInfo Bool
solidCustomerInfo = CustomerInfo True
```

When we add a single parameter, the number of inhabitants for our new type is equal to the number of inhabitants of the value it contains. In our example, we can have two different CustomerInfo values, one that we created by passing in True and one we created by passing in False.

```haskell
data CustomerInfo = CustomerInfo Bool Bool
CustomerInfo True True
CustomerInfo True False
CustomerInfo False True
CustomerInfo False False
```

In fact, each time you add a new parameter to your value constructor, the number of inhabitants of your type gets multiplied by the number of inhabitants of the new type. Because the number of inhabitants of a type increases multiplicatively, we often refer to these types in Haskell as `product` types.

Example of using a type as a parameter:

```haskell
data CustomerInfo = CustomerInfo String String Int Int
showCustomer :: CustomerInfo -> String
showCustomer (CustomerInfo firstName lastName count balance) =
  let
    fullName = firstName <> " " <> lastName
    name = "name: " <> fullName
    count' = "count: " <> (show count)
    balance' = "balance: " <> (show balance)
   in
    name <> " " <> count' <> " " <> balance'
```

Example of type pattern-macthing

```haskell
applyDiscount :: CustomerInfo -> CustomerInfo
applyDiscount customer =
  case customer of
    (CustomerInfo "Georgie" "Bird" count balance) -> CustomerInfo "Georgie" "Bird" count (balance `div` 4)
    (CustomerInfo "Porter" "Pupper" count balance) -> CustomerInfo "Porter" "Pupper" count (balance `div` 2)
    otherCustomer -> otherCustomer
```

Example of pattern-macthing specific fields:

```haskell
firstName :: CustomerInfo -> String
firstName (CustomerInfo name _ _ _) = name
lastName :: CustomerInfo -> String
lastName (CustomerInfo _ name _ _) = name
widgetCount :: CustomerInfo -> Int
widgetCount (CustomerInfo _ _ count _) = count
balance :: CustomerInfo -> Int
balance (CustomerInfo _ _ _ balance) = balance
```

Example of field updating:

```haskell
updateFirstName :: CustomerInfo -> String -> CustomerInfo
updateFirstName (CustomerInfo _ lastName count balance) firstName =
    CustomerInfo firstName lastName count balance

updateLastName (CustomerInfo firstName _ count balance) lastName =
  CustomerInfo firstName lastName count balance
```

Product type with named fields called `record` type and its syntax:

```haskell
data CustomerInfo = CustomerInfo
  { firstName :: String
  , lastName :: String
  , widgetCount :: Int
  , balance :: Int
  }

customerGeorge =
  CustomerInfo
    { balance = 100
    , lastName = "Bird"
    , firstName = "George"
    , widgetCount = 10
    }
```

Notice here the named arguments appear in a different order than they do when you defined the record. One advantage to using named arguments is you don’t have to remember the positions of individual arguments. A disadvantage to constructing records this way is you can’t partially apply fields to the data constructor using record syntax.

```haskell
customerFactory :: String -> String -> CustomerInfo
customerFactory fname lname =
  CustomerInfo
    { balance = 0
    , widgetCount = 5
    , firstName = fname
    , lastName = lname
    }
```

Record field names can also be used to access fields of a record. Each record field becomes a function to extract that field from your record. This means that you no longer need to manually write functions to extract record fields. We can see this in action by looking at fields from customerGeorge in ghci:

```haskell
λ firstName customerGeorge
"George"
λ lastName customerGeorge
"Bird"
λ widgetCount customerGeorge
10
λ balance customerGeorge
100
```

Updating records can also be done easily using record update syntax. With record update syntax you can update a specific field of your record based on its name. Let’s use record update syntax to write a function that clears out a user’s widget count and balance:

```haskell
emptyCart :: CustomerInfo -> CustomerInfo
emptyCart customer =
  customer
    { widgetCount = 0
    , balance = 0
    }
```

However, this does not modify the actual value only creates a new version of it.

## Creating Bindings for All Record Fields with Wildcards

Example of using wildcards syntax to retrieve values from data type:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards #-}
showCustomer :: CustomerInfo -> String
showCustomer CustomerInfo{..} =
  firstName
    <> " "
    <> lastName
    <> " "
    <> show widgetCount
    <> " "
    <> show balance
```

Example of using wildcards syntax to retrieve values from data type:

```haskell

customerGeorge =
  let
    firstName = "George"
    lastName = "Bird"
    widgetCount = 10
    balance = 100
   in
    CustomerInfo{..}

customerFactory firstName lastName =
  let
    widgetCount = 10
    balance = 100
   in
    CustomerInfo{..}
```

## Dealing with Duplicate Record Fields

Example below will result in an error because `firstName` and `lastName` fields also have selectors with the same name - functions, and having two functions declared is an error.

```haskell
data CustomerInfo = CustomerInfo
  { firstName :: String
  , lastName :: String
  , widgetCount :: Int
  , balance :: Int
  }

data EmployeeInfo = EmployeeInfo
  { firstName :: String
  , lastName :: String
  , timezone :: String
  , contactInfo :: String
  }
```

## Naming Record Fields

A common idiom in Haskell applications is to simply prefix the record field name with the name of the type:

```haskell
data CustomerInfo = CustomerInfo
  { customerInfoFirstName :: String
  , customerInfoLastName :: String
  , customerInfoWidgetCount :: Int
  , customerInfoBalance :: Int
  }
```
