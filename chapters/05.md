## Creating And Structuring Haskell Projects

```bash
What does the package build:
1. Executable
2. Library
3. Library and Executable
```

This first prompt is asking you what kind of project you’d like to create. For libraries, pick the Library option. If you’re building an application, however, it’s common to use the Library and Executable project rather than just Executable. This supports the common Haskell idiom of creating a very small minimal executable application and putting most of the application logic in a library. Separating out the logic into a library makes testing easier.
