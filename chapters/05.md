## Creating And Structuring Haskell Projects

```bash
What does the package build:
1. Executable
2. Library
3. Library and Executable
```

This first prompt is asking you what kind of project you’d like to create. For libraries, pick the Library option. If you’re building an application, however, it’s common to use the Library and Executable project rather than just Executable. This supports the common Haskell idiom of creating a very small minimal executable application and putting most of the application logic in a library. Separating out the logic into a library makes testing easier.

## Understanding the Cabal File Format

```cabal
-- This is a comment top level comment
-- This is called stanza
library
-- this is an indented comment
    exposed-modules: MyLib -- This comment will cause an error
```

## GHC options

-O0 No optimizations
-O1 Common optimizations
-O2 Thorough optimizations
-prof Profiling
or
cabal configure --enable-profiling To make it project-wise

## Building and Running Your program

```bash
cabal build
cabal build lib:learn-cabal
cabal build exe:learn-cabal
cabal exec learn-cabal
cabal run learn-cabal -- build & run

```
