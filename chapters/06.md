## Creating And Structuring Haskell Projects

Object-oriented programming languages let you solve this problem using inheritance or interfaces to write different implementations of functions depending on their type. The idea that we can provide a different implementation of a function depending on its type is called ad hoc polymorphism. Haskell provides its own approach to ad hoc polymorphism with type classes

## Using Ad Hoc Polymorphism with Type classes

```haskell
data Natural a = Natural
  { equal :: a -> a -> Bool,
    add :: a -> a -> a,
    multiply :: a -> a -> a,
    additiveIdentity :: a,
    multiplicativeIdentity :: a,
    displayAsString :: a -> String
  }

intNatural :: Natural Int
intNatural =
  Natural
    { equal = (==),
      add = (+),
      multiply = (*),
      additiveIdentity = 0,
      multiplicativeIdentity = 1,
      displayAsString = show
    }

data Peano = Z | S Peano

toPeano :: Int -> Peano
toPeano 0 = Z
toPeano n = S $ toPeano (n - 1)

fromPeano :: Peano -> Int
fromPeano Z = 0
fromPeano (S n) = 1 + fromPeano n

peanoNatural :: Natural Peano
peanoNatural =
  Natural
    { equal = comparePeano,
      add = addPeano,
      multiply = multiplyPeano,
      -- In mathematics, the additive identity of a set that is equipped with the operation of addition is an element which, when added to any element x in the set, yields x. One of the most familiar additive identities is the number 0 from elementary mathematics, but additive identities occur in other mathematical structures where addition is defined, such as in groups and rings.
      additiveIdentity = Z,
      -- Multiplicative identity. noun. : an element of a set that when multiplied by any other element of the set leaves the element unchanged.
      multiplicativeIdentity = S Z,
      displayAsString = show . fromPeano
    }
  where
    comparePeano Z Z = True
    comparePeano (S a) (S b) = comparePeano a b
    comparePeano _ _ = False
    addPeano Z b = b
    addPeano (S a) b = addPeano a (S b)
    multiplyPeano Z _ = Z
    multiplyPeano (S a) b =
      addPeano b (multiplyPeano a b)
```

## Creating a Type Class for Natural

```haskell
class Natural n where
  equal :: n -> n -> Bool
  add :: n -> n -> n
  multiply :: n -> n -> n
  additiveIdentity :: n
  multiplicativeIdentity :: n
  displayAsString :: n -> String

instance Natural Int where
  equal = (==)
  add = (+)
  multiply = (*)
  additiveIdentity = 0
  multiplicativeIdentity = 1
  displayAsString = show
```

## Composing Type Classes

With this constraint, weâ€™re requiring that anything that has an instance of Natural should also have an instance of Eq.

```haskell
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool

class (Eq n) => Natural n where
  add :: n -> n -> n
  multiply :: n -> n -> n
  additiveIdentity :: n
  multiplicativeIdentity :: n
  displayAsString :: n -> String
```

Or, with multiple constraints:

```haskell
class (Show n, Eq n) => Natural n where
  add :: n -> n -> n
  multiply :: n -> n -> n
  additiveIdentity :: n
  multiplicativeIdentity :: n
```

Defining equality and show-ity for Peano:

```haskell
instance Eq Peano where
  (==) Z Z = True
  (==) (S a) (S b) = a == b
  (==) _ _ = False
instance Show Peano where
  show Z = "Z"
  show (S a) = "(S " <> show a <> ")"
```

## Creating Default Implementations and Minimal Definitions

```haskell
instance Ord Word8 where
  compare a b
  | a == b = EQ
  | a == 0 = LT
  | b == 0 = GT
  | otherwise = compare (a - 1) (b - 1)
```

Or implement type class:

```haskell
class (Eq a) => Ord a where
  compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
  (<) :: a -> a -> Bool
  a < b =
    case compare a b of
      LT -> True
      _ -> False
  (<=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  a <= b =
    case compare a b of
      GT -> False
      _ -> True
  (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
  a > b =
    case compare a b of
      GT -> True
      _ -> False
  (>=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  a >= b =
    case compare a b of
      LT -> False
      _ -> True
  max :: a -> a -> a
  max a b =
    case compare a b of
      GT -> a
      _ -> b
  min :: a -> a -> a
  min a b =
    case compare a b of
      LT -> a
      _ -> b
```

And one can either instantiate type class:

```haskell

instance Ord Word8 where
  compare a b
    | a == b = EQ
    | a == 0 = LT
    | b == 0 = GT
    | otherwise = compare (a - 1) (b - 1)
```

Or write definition within type class:

```haskell
class Eq a => Ord a where
  compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
  compare a b
    | a == b = EQ
    | a <= b = LT
    | otherwise = GT
-- ...
-- is required because <= points to compare and compare to <=
-- to mitigate circular dependency a MINIMAL pragma is used
{-# MINIMAL compare | (<=) #-}
```
