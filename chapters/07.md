# Understanding IO

## Ordering and Combining IO Actions

```haskell
andThen :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
-- bind
andThen = (>>=)

newIO :: a -> IO a
newIO = return
```
Could this be a callback?

Example of reading content from file and printing it out to the screen:
```haskell
openFile "file.txt" ReadMode 
>>= \handle -> hGetContents handle 
>>= \contents -> putStrLn contents
>>= \_ -> hClose handle
```

## Independently Sequencing IO Actions
```haskell
putStrLn "hello world" >>= putStrLn "nice to meet you" >>= putStrLn "goodbye"
-- won't work because `putStrLn` has `IO ()` type while `>>=` function requires `a -> IO b`
-- to fix this we do
putStrLn "hello world" >>= \_ -> putStrLn "good night world"
```

While the following code will work 100% of the time 
```haskell
putStrLn "Hello"
putStrLn "from"
putStrLn "Main"
```
It is not that trivial the other IO actions will too because there is no guarantee, say, file will be overwritten before read etc.
So to fix this we need to chain IO actions but sometimes without intermediate value:
```haskell
showSomeText :: IO ()
showSomeText =
  putStrLn "this is just some text"
  >>= \_ -> putStrLn "there are many lines of it"
  >>= \_ -> putStrLn "each one a new function"
```haskell
Or:
```haskell
thenCall :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
thenCall a b = a >>= \_ -> b

showWithThenCall :: IO ()
showWithThenCall =
  putStrLn "this is just some text"
  `thenCall` putStrLn "there are many lines of it"
  `thenCall` putStrLn "not one a new function"

-- but there is also already a function that does that:
showWithThenCall :: IO ()
showWithThenCall =
  putStrLn "this is just some text"
  >> putStrLn "there are many lines of it"
  >> putStrLn "not one a new function"
```

## Mapping IO Values with fmap
Whereas `map` function applies funtion `f` to every element of `a` returning `b`, `fmap` does on every `Functor` (idk what `Functor` is)
```haskell
getArgs >>= return . sumArgs >>= print
-- same as
fmap sumArgs getArgs >>= print
-- also because <?> is shorthand to fmap
sumArgs <$> getArgs >>= print

-- I don't understand how `mapM` is going to map maybes if there can be Nothing
-- also how do you sum it then
import Text.Read (readMaybe)
sumArgs :: [String] -> Maybe Int
sumArgs strArgs =
  let intArgs = mapM readMaybe strArgs
  in fmap sum intArgs

-- 
main =
  sumArgs <$> getArgs >>= print
```
