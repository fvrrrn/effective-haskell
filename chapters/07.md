# Understanding IO

## Ordering and Combining IO Actions

```haskell
andThen :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
-- bind
andThen = (>>=)

newIO :: a -> IO a
newIO = return
```
Could this be a callback?

Example of reading content from file and printing it out to the screen:
```haskell
openFile "file.txt" ReadMode 
>>= \handle -> hGetContents handle 
>>= \contents -> putStrLn contents
>>= \_ -> hClose handle
```

## Independently Sequencing IO Actions
```haskell
putStrLn "hello world" >>= putStrLn "nice to meet you" >>= putStrLn "goodbye"
-- won't work because `putStrLn` has `IO ()` type while `>>=` function requires `a -> IO b`
-- to fix this we do
putStrLn "hello world" >>= \_ -> putStrLn "good night world"
```

While the following code will work 100% of the time 
```haskell
putStrLn "Hello"
putStrLn "from"
putStrLn "Main"
```
It is not that trivial the other IO actions will too because there is no guarantee, say, file will be overwritten before read etc.
So to fix this we need to chain IO actions but sometimes without intermediate value:
```haskell
showSomeText :: IO ()
showSomeText =
  putStrLn "this is just some text"
  >>= \_ -> putStrLn "there are many lines of it"
  >>= \_ -> putStrLn "each one a new function"
```haskell
Or:
```haskell
thenCall :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
thenCall a b = a >>= \_ -> b

showWithThenCall :: IO ()
showWithThenCall =
  putStrLn "this is just some text"
  `thenCall` putStrLn "there are many lines of it"
  `thenCall` putStrLn "not one a new function"

-- but there is also already a function that does that:
showWithThenCall :: IO ()
showWithThenCall =
  putStrLn "this is just some text"
  >> putStrLn "there are many lines of it"
  >> putStrLn "not one a new function"
```

## Mapping IO Values with fmap
Whereas `map` function applies funtion `f` to every element of `a` returning `b`, `fmap` does on every `Functor` (idk what `Functor` is)
```haskell
getArgs >>= return . sumArgs >>= print
-- same as
fmap sumArgs getArgs >>= print
-- also because <?> is shorthand to fmap
sumArgs <$> getArgs >>= print

-- I don't understand how `mapM` is going to map maybes if there can be Nothing
-- also how do you sum it then
import Text.Read (readMaybe)
sumArgs :: [String] -> Maybe Int
sumArgs strArgs =
  let intArgs = mapM readMaybe strArgs
  in fmap sum intArgs

-- 
main =
  sumArgs <$> getArgs >>= print
```

## Running IO in Real Applications
```haskell
-- >> operator returns IO (), void if you like, so that any computation inside IO Action will be discarded like so:
putStrLn "test" >> return (1 `div` 0)
-- will not throw as second function is never evaluated

```


In Haskell an expression is not evaluated until it is needed so when you read, say, out of 50000 files you will only actually read them when the result it required:
```haskell
makeAndReadFile :: Int -> IO String
makeAndReadFile fnumber =
  let fname = "/tmp/test/" <> show fnumber
  in writeFile fname fname >> readFile fname
unsafe :: IO ()
unsafe =
  let files = mapM makeAndReadFile [1..50000] :: IO [String]
  in files >>= (putStrLn . show)
```
Will probably throw an error as we try to open 50000 files at once. To mitigate that we need to change:
```haskell
makeAndShow :: Int -> IO ()
makeAndShow n = makeAndReadFile n >>= putStrLn
-- and then
safe :: IO ()
safe = mapM makeAndShow [1..500]
-- but that would also change type to IO [()]
safe :: IO ()
safe = foldl (\io id -> io >> makeAndShow id) (return ()) [1..500]

-- same
safe = mapM_ makeAndShow [1..500]
```
We start our fold with an empty IO action containing an initial value of (). Then we reduce our list with >>, each time sequencing the previous IO action with the current one, and discarding the results. In the end, weâ€™re left with a single IO action.

```haskell
-- Exercise 1
returnHello :: IO (IO String)
returnHello = return (return "Hello")

-- Exercise 2
returnIOWA :: IO (IO wa) -> IO wa
returnIOWA io = io >>= id

-- Exercise 3
returnArrayIO :: [IO wa] -> IO [wa]
returnArrayIO [] = return []
returnArrayIO (x:xs) = do
  x' <- x
  xs' <- returnArrayIO xs
  return $ x' : xs'

-- Exercise 4
runBind = getLine >>= \line1 -> getLine >>= \line2 -> print (read line2 + read line1)
runBind = getArgs >>= print . sum . map read

runDo :: IO ()
runDo = do
  arguments <- getArgs
  let sumOfArgs = sum $ map read arguments
  print sumOfArgs

-- Exercise 5
mapOperandOperation :: String -> Maybe ([Integer] -> Integer)
mapOperandOperation =
  \case 
   "+" -> Just sum
   "*" -> Just product
   "-" -> Just $ foldl1 (-)
   "/" -> Just $ foldl1 div
   _ -> undefined

calculate :: [String] -> Integer
calculate =
  \case
    [] -> undefined
    [_] -> undefined
    (operand:numbers) -> 
      case mapOperandOperation operand of
        Just operation -> operation $ map read numbers
        Nothing -> undefined

runCalculator :: IO ()
runCalculator = do
  args <- getArgs
  case args of
    [] -> putStrLn argsError
    [_] -> putStrLn argsError
    _ -> print $ calculate args
  where
    argsError =
      "Missing arg(s). Need an operator and at least 1 number"
    -- opError op =
    --   op <> " - Unrecognized Operator. Please use one of +,*,-,/"

-- :set args foo bar 
-- or
-- import System.Environment
-- withArgs ["+", "1", "2"] runCalculator
```
